## ðŸ›  **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS**

### **State Management Strategy**
- **Tanstack Query**: For server state management and caching
- **useReducer + Context**: For complex local state (like forms)
- **Custom Hooks**: For reusable business logic
- **Zustand**: If global client state becomes complex

### **Form Management**
- **React Hook Form**: For form state and validation
- **Zod**: For schema validation and TypeScript integration
- **Custom Form Components**: Following atomic design principles

### **Data Fetching Pattern**
```typescript
// Example hook pattern for data fetching
const useBusinessListings = (filters: BusinessFilters) => {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['businesses', filters],
    queryFn: () => businessService.getBusinesses(filters),
    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
  });
};
```

### **Component Structure**
```
components/TourismCMS/
â”œâ”€â”€ atoms/          (Button, Input, Icon, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ molecules/      (SearchBar, FormField, Card, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ organisms/      (DataTable, Dashboard, Forms, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/      (Page layouts)
â””â”€â”€ pages/          (Complete page components)
```
